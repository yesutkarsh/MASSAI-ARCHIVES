Steps to solver problem:
1: Understanding
   - What is Given
   - What is Asked
   - Constraints

2: Planning
   - How and What algorithm to use or technique to use.

3: Execution
  - Implementing the algorithm


No If we are given any problem, below are steps to solve:

1. Think Pseudocode
Pseudocode means basic skeleton/logic that states how we can code the particular problem.

2. Execeute 
Cover pseudocode to code

 

Concept of Dry Run
- Manual walking through pseudocode
