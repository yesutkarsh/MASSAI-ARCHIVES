Importants/Things I Learned from Today's Lecture


1. What Is Complexity?

We can Do any task by coding with higher or lower complexity depending how good our code is.
So' algorithm is a set of instruction that lead to optimal solution, better the code better the complexity.


2. Time and Space Complexity.

2. 1: Time Complexity
Time Complexity tells running time of an Algorithm/how the running time will change as task changes.
As task increates or size of task increases the time will increase.


2. 2: Space Complexity
Space complexity means how much space/computer memory is required by our algorithm.

 




3: Types of Time Complexity
3.1 Constant Time Complexity
    - When Contant Time Complexity the running time of Algorithm will be always me same regardless of input size.
	Ex: Let say <case 1: Array of 100 > and <case 2: 1000 array> and we want to get element at index 20, in both cases the Algorithm will take same amoutn of time to get the element of 20th index.
