6: Identify Scope Creep in a Project
Scope
Homepage
All Bakery Products
Contact Information
Map to visit site.


No originally we decided to only build website, not ecommerce so adding to cart is outside of scope.


New Scope
Homepage
All Bakery Items
Cart
Checkout
Contact Information
Map to visit site.


Adding cart will increase overall development time of website as now we need to handle payments, tracking and  authentication.
